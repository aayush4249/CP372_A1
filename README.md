We created a virtual post it board through a client and a multithreaded server application that can communicate with each other. Using the client users should be able to post notes on the board, get notes on the board, pin/unpin notes and clear notes. Notes have specific colours that the user defines when creating the server along with the board dimensions. If no colour is selected then the default colour is set. Users are also given defined error messages for issues such as invalid dimensions, colours etc.
