A virtual post it board through a client and a multithreaded server application that communicates via the web. Using the client.java users should be able to post notes on the board, get notes on the board, pin/unpin notes and clear notes. The server.java file runs the server and sets properties such as colors, size etc. The client must know the server's IP address and include a valid port number for a succesful connection. Notes have specific colours that the user defines when creating the server along with the board dimensions. If no colour is selected then the default colour is set. Users are also given defined error messages for issues such as invalid dimensions, colours etc.
